# Klipperscreen Riser
![sm_green_top](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc55ad02-fd05-4532-a51e-7a7885fc6c25)

I designed this riser to use a 11-pin [ribboncable](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805087347551.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.16.5b981802oz6h32&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa) to rise a [small TFT](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805467182919.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.25.193f1802pya02f&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa) off my rasberry PI zero 2W. this allowed me to have the screen on the front of my priter and the raspberry pi in the back with the rest of the electronics. It also includes a switch for the backlight! [Here's the screenwiki page I found the pinout on.](http://www.lcdwiki.com/3.5inch_RPi_Display).
